        <h1>Easy Py Messaging Tutorial</h1>

        <div id="toc"></div>

        <p>This section provides a cookbook approach to
        incorporating messaging into your code. </p>

        <div class="info">The user written examples in this section do not
        get installed. They are meant to be run from the distribution
        directories. This simple, basic code may, however, become an
        integral part of you applications.</div>
            
        <p>The target audience is noobies using RaspberryPi hardware with a
        Raspian OS. Other platforms such as arduino, ubuntu, debian, OSX
        should run fine as well. Most linux systems should work as well.
        Thus, the terminology hopefully provides an easy, simple way to
        program your messaging requirements.</p>

        <p>The user must write code to connect the
        message sender and the message receiver. The commonly
        used name of client and server specify who sends and
        who receives. for many applications user written code
        can be minimal.</p>

        <p>In this system when a client sends a message to a server,
        the client must wait for a response from the server.
        This is called "lockstep" because a client becomes
        "locked" (or "blocked") waiting for a response. </p>

        <p><center><img src="./images/client_server_basic.png"></center></p>

        <p>The above diagram displays the major components
        of message transactions. The dashed boxes highlight
        the two parts of code that a user must write. The
        two boxes with solid lines supply the lower level
        logic that performs the actual messaging.</p>

        <p>The message flow from the above diagram:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>The client has a message to send.</li>

            <li>The internal client_create_class uses the
            configuation supplied by client_create_basic.</li>

            <li>ZeroMQ sends the message over the configured port
            to the use configured server, server_create_basic.</li>

            <li>server_create_basic has ZeroMQ running through
            server_create_class</li>

            <li>The received message gets processed by
            the user defined function, <code>server_create_class</code></li>

            <li>The response message then gets sent back to
            client_create_class using ZeroMQ code.</li>

            <li>client_create_basic gets the response.</li>

        </ol>

        <p>Internally server_create_basic calls a user
        defined function to actually do something with
        the message and form a response. More on this later.</p>

        <h2>Minimal Client Logic</h2>

        <p>Writing the user client code takes only a few
        lines of code. Place this code in 
        <code>client_create_skeleton.py</code> and start it
        in a terminal window:</p>

        <pre>
#!/usr/bin/env python
import client_create_class

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Default values for configuration.
    config = {
        #'node': 'localhost',
        #'port': 5590,
    }
    client = client_create_class.ClientCreateClass(config)
    client.start()

    msg1 = 'Hello world!'
    msg2 = 'The second message'
    msg3 = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    msg4 = 'numbers: 0123456789'
    msg5 = 'qwerty keyboard'
    for msg in [msg1, msg2, msg3, msg4, msg5]:
        print 'Sending : "%s"' % msg
        response = client.send(msg)
        print 'Response: "%s"\n' % response
    client.join()
        </pre>

        <p>The initial line permits execution of this
        code as a command line. For this to work the
        execute permissions must exist on this file:<br/>
        <code class="indent">chmod a+x client_create_skeleton.py</code><br/>
        </p>

        <p>This code must know about the code that actually
        connects to the messaging system:<br/>
        <code class="indent">import client_create_class</code><br/>
        This <code>import</code> loads the easy messaging
        interface to the lower level ZeroMQ code - but these
        details have been encapsulated for ease of use.</p>

        <p>The commented out values of #node and #port indicate the 
        default values will be used.</p>

        <p>The <code>config</code> dictionary allows user
        configuration for the communications to the server.
        In more real-life messaging a user will likely
        change the port and node to match the server's
        location and port. For example, if the server
        lives on a system called <code>"hammer"</code>, change the
        <code>node</code> value to <code>"hammer"</code>.</p>

        <p>Most realistic system use multiple communications
        channels. The communcations connect by using
        different ports. The default port for client/server
        communications in the Easy Py Messaging system
        uses port 5590. As long as the server port
        matches, almost any port will work.</p>

        <p>Creating the connection and opening communications
        channels happens by:<br/>
        <code class="indent">client = client_create_class.ClientCreateClass(config)</code><br/><code class="indent">client.start()</code><br/>

        <p>Sending and receiving responses can now commence.</p>

        <p>A few silly message get sent and responses printed
        in the <code>for</code> loop. The actual sending and
        receiving of a response happens at:<br/>
        <code class="indent">response = client.send(msg)</code><br/>

        <p>The simple client example then exits.</p>

        <h2>Minimal Server Logic</h2>

        <p>The above client sends messages to a server.
        The server receives a message and produces a response.
        The response gets returned to the client and the client
        does whatever with the returned message.</p>

        <p>The Easy Pi Messaging server has simple logic
        comparable to the client logic. The code for 
        <code>server_create_basic.py</code> must be started
        in another terminal:</p>

        <pre>
#!/bin/env python
import server_create_class
import signal
signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal.SIG_DFL)
signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, signal.SIG_DFL)

def handle_request(ident, msg):
    return ident, msg + '_resp'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    config = {
        #'port': 5590,
        'noisy': True,
        'in_fcn': handle_request,
    }

    server = server_create_class.ServerCreateClass(config)
    server.start()

    while True:
        server.join(1)
        </pre>

        <p>Once again, the initial line permits execution of
        this python script as a command line utlity if
        execution permissions are set:<br/>
        <code class="indent">chmod a+x server_create_basic.py</code><br/>

        <p>The connection between the lower level logic that actually
        performs the messaging and our code happens with:<br/>
        <code class="indent">import server_create_class</code><br/>

        <p>The next few lines setup a response so the server
        may become sensitive to Ctrl-C for program termination.
        Without this user interface feature stopping the server
        could be cumbersome and confusing.</p>

        <p>The <code>config</code> provides configuration information
        the underlying logic. These configuration options are:</p>

        <table>

            <tr>
                <td><b>Name</b></td>
                <td><b>Default Value</b></td>
                <td><b>Definition</b></td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>'port'</td>
                <td>5590</td>
                <td>The port number for this server. In normal
                    use this port number will almost always <i>not</i>
                    use 5590, but something different. Both client
                    and server <i>must</i> have matching port number
                    for proper communications.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>'noisy'</td>
                <td>False</td>
                <td>This setting answers the question, "Does the
                    server echo traffic to the console?" Except
                    for debugging, the "noisy" configuration
                    should always be False. For out example
                    code, setting this to True allows us to
                    view traffic on the console.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>'in_fcn'</td>
                <td><i id="shout">NONE!</i></td>
                <td><code id="shout">in_fcn</code> specfies the function
                    that handles incoming messages for this
                    communications channel. The message
                    gets sent to this function, a response
                    gets created, and the response gets
                    communicated back to the client.</td>
            </tr>

        </table>

        <a name="handle_request"></a>
        <h3>Process the Incoming Request: handle_request</h3>

        <p>The key to processing incoming messages rests in
        the <code>in_fcn</code> function. <code>in_fcn</code>
        <i>must</i> have a user implementation. For this
        simple example, the string <code>'_resp'</code> gets
        appended to the input message and returned to the
        client.</br>

        <pre>
def handle_request(ident, msg):
    return ident, msg + '_resp'
        </pre>

        <p>In this call, <code>ident</code> identifies the source
        of the message by the client name. This may be useful
        depending upon message significance.</p>

        <p><code>msg</code> provides the actual message as
        received by the server. In our vastly simplified example
        the only handling concatenates <code>'_resp'</code>
        to the message.</p>

        <p>After processing, the ident and modified message get
        returned. The user code does not have to worry beyond
        creating a proper <code>handle_request()</code> function.
        Internal processing manages receiving, calling
        <code>handle_request()</code> and responding to the
        client with the modified message. Simple, right?</p>


        <h2>Normal Operation</h2>

        <p>To run the above example, first start the server that
        responds to our messages:<br/>
        <code class="indent">python server_create_test.py</code><br/>
        </p>
        
        <p>Then, in a different terminal in the same directory
        as server_create_test.py, run the above sample:<br/>
        <code class="indent">python client_create_skeleton.py</code><br/>
        </p>

        <p>The output should be:</p>

        <pre>
Connected: tcp://localhost:5590
Sending : "Hello world!"
Response: "Hello world!_resp"

Sending : "The seond message"
Response: "The seond message_resp"

Sending : "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Response: "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz_resp"

Sending : "numbers: 0123456789"
Response: "numbers: 0123456789_resp"

Sending : "qwerty"
Response: "qwerty_resp"
        </pre>

        <p> The response has a suffix of <code>_resp</code>
        appended to each response string. This appended string
        was supplied by server_client_test.py that indicates
        it received the message and supplied a distinct
        response.</p>

        <p>For this tutorial examples, the messages have been
        hard-coded in to the program. This simplifies the
        example.</p>

        <p>In actual situations a response would become
        something much different. Perhaps a response of
        <code>OK</code> or <code>temp=81.5</code> would
        be more appropriate. And, or course, messages
        would get created from programatic sources
        instead of hard-coded messages.</p>

        <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

        <p>Under normal operations a client becomes locked
        for only a short time. This time may range from
        nearly instantaneous to a few seconds.  If the message
        simply required a status of something, the response
        should be very quick. A more complicated message
        that required something like starting a pump and
        reporting when it has started could take a few
        seconds.</p>

        <p>Some reasons a client can get locked:</p>

        <ul>

            <li>The client or server was incorrectly configured. This should
            happen only during debugging. Check that both client and server
            use the same port. Use the <code>listening</code> utility to
            verify that the port has no listeners before staring
            the example run.</li>

            <li>Did you start the server? The client will wait
            indefinitely until it can connect. Run the listening
            utility to verify the server is running:<br/>
            <code id="indent">listening 5590</code><br/>
            One instance of the server should appear as output.</li>

            <li>The server has crashed or otherwise can no
            longer response. In other words, nothing can
            answer that message.</li>

            <li>The application is in the process of starting
            and the server has not yet begun to process messages.</li>

            <li>The server is too busy to respond. Hopefully it
            will respond shortly.</li>

            <li>The system of the client or server is crashing
            and processes exhibit erratic behavior.</li>

            <li>If you wish to test messaging with another
            hardware box, the "node" option must be properly
            configured. Either a name or IP address suffices
            for the "node" value.</li>

        </ul>

        <h1>"Hardened" Client/Server Examples</h1>

        <p>The client and server examples above provide an
        introductory toy example of how to write messaging
        connections. Hardening them into a resonable utility
        involves a bit more. These "hardened" utilities
        can serve as debugging aids as you develop your
        own versions.</p>

        <h2>server_create_test.py Utility</h2>

        <p>This utility acts as a server for a single communications
        channel. The runtime options:</p>

        <pre>
python server_create_test.py --help
server_create_class.py [--help] [--port] [--noisy]
	--help         = This blurb
	--port=aport   = Port to expect queries.
	--noisy        = Noisy reporting. Echo progress.
        </pre>

        <p>Nothing complicated; this can be useful.</p>

        <h2>client_create_test.py Utility</h2>

        <p>As your server becomes more complicated, sending
        messages with the client can ease development pains
        and provide a debugging aid.</p>

        <pre>
python client_create_test.py --help
client_create_test.py [--help] [--port] \
		[--timing] [arg1 arg2 arg3 ...]
	--help         = This blurb
	--port=aport   = Port to expect queries.
	--node=anode   = Node name or IP address of server_create_class.
		Default is localhost
	--timing       = Run timing loop only.
	arg1 ...       = Arbitrary message string
        </pre>

        <p>This utility sends messages to the server and prints
        the response. It runs as a command line utlity and send
        all the args as a single space separated message.</p>

        <p>The "--timing" option sends 1,000 messages to the
        server for performance timing. This should provide an idea
        of your application efficiency. This may or may not
        be an important part of your project. Using this
        option definitely implies that the server does
        <i>not</i> use the <code>--noisy</code>; otherwise
        a lot of printouts will kill any timings!</p>

        <p>As an example of using this utility:<br/>
        <code class="indent">python client_create_test.py Hello world</code>
        <br/>results in:<br/>
        <code class="indent">Hello world_resp</code><br>
        because the default message processing function simply
        append "_resp" to a message.</p>

        <h1>Absolute Minimal Code Example</h1>

        <p>To demonstrate the absolute minimal code necessary
        to create and use a messaging channel, the "nano"
        versions illustrate the ease of using this package.</>

        <p>client_create_nano.py</p>

        <pre class="indent">
import client_create_class
client = client_create_class.ClientCreateClass({})
client.start()
msg = 'Hello world!'
print 'Sending : "%s"' % msg
response = client.send(msg)
print 'Response: "%s"\n' % response
client.join()
        </pre>

        <p>server_create_nano.py</p>

        <pre class="indent">
import server_create_class
def handle_request(ident, msg):
    return ident, msg + '_resp'
config = { 'in_fcn': handle_request }
server = server_create_class.ServerCreateClass(config)
server.start()
while True:
    server.join(1)
        </pre>

        <p>As before, execute the server in one window,<br/><code class="indent">
            python server_create_nano.py</code><br/>
        and execute the client in another window:<br/>
        <code class="indent">python client_create_nano.py</code><br/></p>

        <p>That's 8 lines for the client and 9 lines for the server.
        Pretty slick, right?</p>

        <p>(Kill the server by sending it into the background: Ctrl-Z
        and then "kill %1". Getting it to recognize Ctrl-C was the
        purpose of the signal calls in the more expansive version.)</p>

        <h1>More than one messaging requirement per app?</h1>

        <p>Many applications require multiple messaging
        channels. One desktop system that monitors
        multiple external hardware boxes can send/receive
        messages from each of the external boxes. Any
        hardware box can use multiple messaging channels.
        This package recommends using the centralized logging
        code as one messaging channel.</p>

        <p>A simple solution exists: implement your own
        specialized client_create_basic.py and server_create_basic.py
        for each channel. In your server code, you also need to
        implement your own version of <code>handle_request()</code>.
        See <a href="#handle_request">
            handle_request</a> and the surrounding discussion for details.</p>
