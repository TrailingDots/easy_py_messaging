        <h2>Features of Easy Py Messaging</h2>

        <p><i>Easy Py Messaging</i> provides a small cross-platform python
        coded toolkit for easy, reliable communications between nodes, within a
        single desktop for multiple processes or just within a single process.
        Just send a message and the API delivers your message.</p>

        <p>Easy Py Messaging provides a wrapper around <a href="http://zeromq.org">ZeroMQ</a>
        to implement a logger and an API for messaging.
        Multiple additional utilites support the code.</p>

        <p>With the use of this toolkit, developers can easily communicate
        between thread in their code, between different processes and
        even between different nodes on their network.</p>

        <p>While this code was originally developed for the Raspberry Pi
        running the Raspian OS, it has worked successfully on Mac OSX and
        Linux Centos 7 systems. No attempt has been made for operation on
        Windows.</p>

        <h2>Feature Overview</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>Python API using the industry standard <a href="http://www.zeromq.org">ZeroMQ</a>
            library. ZeroMQ has a proven track record for speed of
            delivery and a robust API.</li>

            <li>Asynchronous handling. Messages queues provide the ability to
            fire-and-forget. For input, quering a messages queue may either
            await a message or continue processing.</li>

            <li>Robust messaging. ZeroMQ permits various processes to
            go down while supplying recovery connections when the
            processes restarts. Sorry, persistence is not currently
            implemented.</li>

            <li>Symmetrical connections. Messages use TCP for
            bi-directional connections.</li>


            <li>Multiple support utilties. These utilities support
            your development and debugging efforts.</li>

        <h2>The Tools</h2>

        <h3><a href="./logCollector.html">logCollector</a> - Collect the logs</h3>

        <p>The <a href="./logCollector.html">logCollector</a>
        documentation provides a thorough overview of log collection. A decent
        logging system significantly eases development because it allows simple
        tracking of information between various nodes and processes.</p>

        <h3><a href="./logCollector.html#logFilterApp">logFilterApp</a> - analyze logs</h3>

        <p>Once logs get written to a file, what happens? Log files can easily
        get large and manually skimming them becomes boring and prone to
        overlooking relevant information. logFilter provides elementary
        processing and filtering of these log files.</p>

        <h3><a href="./logCollector.html#loggingLoopApp">LoggingLoopApp</a> - loop testing configurations</h3>

        <p>The loggingLoopApp gets used while developing applications.
        It sends logs to the logger once per second and provides
        feedback that the system for logs has a proper configuration.</p>

        <h3><a href="./logCollector.html#loggingSpeedTest">loggingSpeedTest</a> - how fast can you communicate?</h3>

        <p>How fast is your system? While speeds depend primarily
        upon your network, this utility will send 100,000 logs
        and report the time. What is yout timing for internal
        only, connected with ethernet cables, wireless
        connection?</p>

        <!--
        <h3><a href="./dirSvc.html">dirSvc</a> - Directory for Naming Servies</h3>

        <p><a href="easy_naming_service">Easy Naming Service</a>
        eases the configuration problems by supplying a symbolic
        naming connection between various services in your
        systems.</p>
        -->


        <h3>The Easy Messaging Utilties</h3>

        <p>This package contains multiple utilities to enhance the
        simple environment of the basic package.</p>

        <h4><a href="./logCollector.html#logCmd">logCmd</a> - Command line messaging</h4>

        <p>The basic code of <a href="./logCollector.html#logCmd">logCmd</a> displays the
        ease of sending messages from an app. The additional command line
        options turn this code into a powerful command line utility.
        Interested developers could use this as the basis for a chat app.</p>

        <!--
        <h4><a href="./dirSvc.html">dirSvc</a> - The directory naming service</h4>

        <p>A directory naming service allows much more flexible
        configurations by using names for the various components
        of your system instead of obscure items such as IP
        addresses.</p>

        <h4><a href="./dirClient.html">dirClient</a> - Interrogating the nameing service.</h4>

        <p>This utility exercises the naming service. Useful for
        checking out configurations in development.</p>
        -->

        <h4><a href="./logCollector.html#listening">listening</a> - Determing what process listens to a port</h4>

        <p>This utility answers the frequent question found on various forums
        "How do I find out which process is listening to a port?"
        I didn't like the most of the answers, so I wrote this one. Enjoy.</p>

        <p>In the process of developing and debugging your
        systems, processes frequently continue to run while
        listening to a port. Unless a utility such as
        <a href="./logCollector.html#listening">listening</a> provides
        a mapping between the port number and the process,
        interpreting the "Address already in use" error message can prove
        tricky.</p>

        <h1>Glossary</h1>

        <h2>Client/Server</h2>

        <p>The terms of client and server describe which component
        sends a message and which component receives a message.</p>

        <p>Traditionally servers contain powerful computers or
        processes dedicated to managing disk drives, printers
        or network connections. Clients, on the other hand,
        talk to server to obtain necessary information to
        perform their operations.</p>

        <p>In the Easy Py Messaging systems the use of client
        and server does not necessarily hint at power, but of
        sources and consumers of information.</p>

        <h3>Servers as Resource Providers</h3>

        <p>In Easy Py Messaging a server defines a source of
        information that communicates with clients. A server
        may exist on a separate node from a client or it may
        run on the same node as a client or it may even
        exist as a separate thread within the same process.</p>

        <p>A server provides some kind of information or resource
        within a system or distributed system. When a client
        requests a resource, the server shares the resource
        with the requesting client.</p>

        <h3>Clients as Resource Consumers</h3>

        <p>A client requests a service from a server.
        Multiple clients may use a single server for resources.
        A client may exist on the same hardware as a server
        or may even run on the same process. Clients and servers
        may also run on different hardware boxes. In this case
        clients and servers typically talk to each other
        through a network.</p>

        <h3>Client/Server Discussion</h3>

        <p>In the Easy Py Messaging model, messages typically start
        with a client requesting a resource from some server.
        A client sends a request to a server and the server
        fulfills the request and generally responds with some
        kind of acknowledgement.</p>
        
        <p>An application may use multiple clients and each client
        will generally talk to different servers.</p>

        <p>An Easy Py Messaging server can use multiple threads
        for handling requests. Using multiple threads can provide
        better performance.</p>

        <p>Both clients and servers
        have previosly agreed upon message structures.</p>

        <p>An example of a client/server with the server
        providing a response would be a node that request
        instrument readings from a remote hardware box.
        The client or requestor could be a desktop seeking
        readings from a hydroponics controller in the backyard.
        A single request on the desktop could cause the hydroponics
        controller to response with all instrumentation sending
        possibly multiple messages back to the desktop.</p>

        <p>An example of a client using a resource without
        a response would be the logging server. A client
        simply calls the logger API with a message and the
        logger silently records the log.</p>

        <p>An example of a server initiating a discussion
        could be the "ping" sometimes used to announce the
        availability of the server's services. A "ping"
        get broadcast on a known port with a known accouncement
        structure. Interested processes would listen to this
        port and record the existence of the service.</p>
