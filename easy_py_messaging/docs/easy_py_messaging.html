        <h2>Features of Easy Py Messaging</h2>

        <p><i>Easy Py Messaging</i> provides a small cross-platform python
        coded toolkit for easy, reliable communications between nodes, within a
        single desktop for multiple processes or just within a single process.
        Just send message and the API delivers your message.</p>

        <p>Easy Py Messaging provides a wrapper around <a href="http://zeromq.org">ZeroMQ</a>
        to implement a logger, a directory naming service and an API for
        user implementions. Multiple additional utilites support the code.</p>

        <h2>Feature Overview</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>Python API using the industry standard <a href="http://www.zeromq.org">ZeroMQ</a>
            library. ZeroMQ has a proven track record for speed of
            delivery and a robust API.</li>

            <li>Asynchronous handling. Messages queues provide the
            ability to fire-and-forget. For input, a queue query
            may either await a message or contnue.</li>

            <li>Robust messaging. ZeroMQ permits various processes to
            go down while supplying recovery connections when the
            processes restarts. Sorry, persistence is not currently
            implemented.</li>

            <li>Symmetrical connections. Messages use TCP for
            bi-directional connections.</li>

            <li>Multiple support utilties. These utilities support
            your development and debugging efforts.</li>

            <ul>

                <li>logCollector. The primary tool for collecting
                and storing logs.</li>

                <li>logCmd. Send logs and commands from the shell
                command line.</li>

                <li>loggingLoopApp. Send a log message once a second
                for debugging configurations.</li>

                <li>logFilterApp. Given a log file, extract relevant
                information.</li>

                <li>dirSvc. A directory naming service. Connect your
                applications by name instead of port. This greatly
                simplifies your configuation files.</li>

                <li>loggingSpeedTest. How fast does this system
                operate with your network configuration?</li>

            </ul>

        </ul>

        <h2>The Tools</h2>

        <h3><a href="./logCollector.html">logCollector</a> - Collect the logs</h3>

        <p>The <a href="./logCollector.html">logCollector</a>
        documentation provides a thorough overview of log collection. A decent
        logging system significantly eases development because it allows simple
        tracking of information between various nodes and processes.</p>

        <h3><a href="./logFilterApp">logFilterApp</a> - analyze logs</h3>

        <p>Once logs get written to a file, what happens? Log files can easily
        get large and manually skimming them becomes boring and prone to
        overlooking relevant information. logFilter provides elementary
        processing and filtering of these log files.</p>

        <h3><a href="./loggingLoopApp.html">LoggingLoopApp</a> - loop testing configurations</h3>

        <p>The loggingLoopApp gets used while developing applications.
        It sends logs to the logger once per second and provides
        feedback that the system for logs has a proper configuration.</p>

        <h3><a href="./loggingSpeedTest.html">loggingSpeedTest</a> - how fast can you communicate?</h3>

        <p>How fast is your system? While speeds depend primarily
        upon your network, this utility will send 100,000 logs
        and report the time. What is yout timing for internal
        only, connected with ethernet cables, wireless
        connection?</p>

        <h3><a href="./dirSvc.html">dirSvc</a> - Directory for Naming Servies</h3>

        <p><a href="easy_naming_service">Easy Naming Service</a>
        eases the configuration problems by supplying a symbolic
        naming connection between various services in your
        systems.</p>


        <h3>The Easy Messaging Utilties</h3>

        <p>This package contains multiple utilities to enhance the
        simple environment of the basic package.</p>

        <h4><a href="./logCmd.html">logCmd</a> - Command line messaging</h4>

        <p>The basic code of <a href="./logCmd.html">logCmd</a> displays the
        ease of sending messages from an app. The additional command line
        options turn this code into a powerful command line utility.
        Interested developers could use this as the basis for a chat app.</p>

        <h4><a href="./dirSvc.html">dirSvc</a> - The directory naming service</h4>

        <p>A directory naming service allows much more flexible
        configurations by using names for the various components
        of your system instead of obscure items such as IP
        addresses.</p>

        <h4><a href="./dirClient.html">dirClient</a> - Interrogating the nameing service.</h4>

        <p>This utility exercises the naming service. Useful for
        checking out configurations in development.</p>

        <h4><a href="./listening.html">listening</a> - Determing what process listens to a port</h4>

        <p>In the process of developing and debugging your
        systems, processes frequently continue to run while
        listening to a port. Unless a utility such as
        <a href="./listening.html">listening</a> provides
        a mapping between the port number and the process,
        interpreting the output error message can prove
        tricky. This utility answers the frequent question on various forums
        "How do I find out which process is listening to a port?"</p>
