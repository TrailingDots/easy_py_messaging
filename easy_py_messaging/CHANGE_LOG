Simple Log Messaging Change Log
===================================

Version 1.1.0 - May 25, 2017
------------------------------
* Significant re-org due to installation issues.
  Python REALLY need a new philosophy for 
  installing.

  Moved the socket utility listeningPort.py
  into its own github at:
  https://github.com/TrailingDots/ListeningPort.git
  The blog is at:
  https://CraftsmanshipForSoftware.com

  Updated the runTests.sh to better control
  the test environment. The only outstanding
  feature I want to add is the poor interaction
  with background processes.

  Need to review and re-org the documentation.
  The number of html docs, 5, produces a sense
  of confusion in user - my mind reading.
  Consolidate this into a fewer number:
  a tutorial and in depth docs.

  The Makefile targeting installation needs
  serious work. One user rightfully complained
  about this.


Version 1.0.0 - April 21, 2016
------------------------------
* Initial public release.
