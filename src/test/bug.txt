In the process of writing a python ZeroMQ based logging systems,
I am encountering a nasty bug that I don't understand.
Specifically, trying to send a message with self.socket.send_string()
sometimes fails with self.socket == None.

The particular test case sends 10,000 messages per i nvocation.
When the invocations loop, about 6 per 100 cases bomb with
self.socket == None.

I thought I understood that each thread needs its own context,
but somehow I missing something.
