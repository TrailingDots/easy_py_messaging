        <h1>Easy Messaging Example Code</h1>

        <div id="toc"></div>

        <p> The following code provides examples of the various
        messaging this package offers:</p>

        <p>Based on Async Client/Server pattern. p. 111</p>

        <p>Send forget - Send message, then continue</p>

        <p>Send reliable - Reliably send a message. Msg queued,
        sender continues</p>

        <p>Send reliabe/continue - Queue msg to be sent when receiver
        ready</p>

        <p>Send reliable with receipt - Reliable send with receipt.
        Asynchronous.</p>

        <p>Sender checks for receipt at a later time.</p>


        <p>The easy messaging app implementation derives from the
        Asynchronous Client/Server Pattern  in <a
        href="http://www.zeromq.com">ZeroMQ</a>, p. 111: <br/><center><img

        <h2>Overall Example Requirements</h2>


        <p>Examples of messaging apps that sends messages
         to another task and handles the return
         message.</p>

         <p>This section discusses the various kinds of messaging
         (with and without timeout). Please perform the following
         in an empty directory:<br/><code class="indent">https://github.com/imatix/zguide.git</code><br/>
         This creates a directory of example code for ZeroMQ.
         This section will cover some, but not all, of these
         samples and provide comments on their application to
         easy messaging.</p>

         <p>After downloading the above code, <code class="ident">cd cd zguide/examples/Py</code><br/>to view ZeroMQs example code for Python.</p>

             <h3>Request with Reply</h3> 
            
             <p>The reference for this example: <a href="http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#Ask-and-Ye-Shall-Receive">0MQ - The Guide: Ask and Ye Shall Receive</a></p>

             <p>In this scenario, the simplest messaging to
             understand, sends a message to a reciever. The
             receiver then prints that message.</br/><center>
                 <img src="./images/RequestWithReply.png"/><br/></center></p>
             <p>To test this exchange, use two terminal and <code>cd</code> to the directory of the python examples. In one terminal start the sender:<br/><code class="indent">python hwserver.py</code><br/>
             and in the other terminal send some messages:<br/>
             <code class="indent">python hwclient.py</code>.

             <p>Experiment with variations. Start hwclient.py, wait
             a few seconds, then start hwserver.py. Start both
             programs, kill one, wait, then restart. Unless
             you learn to "play" with your code, you cannot
             consider it your own.</p>
             
             <p>Notice hwclient.py
             waits until hwserver.py can accept the messages. 
             hwclient.py becomes <i>blocked</i> until hwserver.py
             accepts the message. Additionally, hwclient.py waits
             again blocks until hwserver.py sends the response.</p>

             <p>Thus, hwclient.py and hwserver.py work in lockstop
             with each other. This may or may not yield desirable
             behavior for your project!</p>
             
             <p>This behavior simulates an implementation of raw
             sockets unfortunately common to many elementary
             communications applications. ZeroMQ offers much more
             in the form of resilience, time outs, and 
             automatic retries.</p>

             <p>If you have found the above interesting,
             please read the original ZeroMQ exposition
             at <a href="http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#Ask-and-Ye-Shall-Receive">0MQ - The Guide: Ask and Ye Shall Receive</a>.</p>


             <h3>Reliable send with response and no wait</h3>

             <p>This version implements <a
             href="http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#The-Asynchronous-Client-Server-Pattern">the
             Asynchronous Client/Server Pattern</a>. In plain terms this
             means you send a message and continue processing. Later,
             whenever the logic in you application can take a break, the
             response queue gets polled for a response to previously sent
             messages.</p>

             <p>"Asynchronous" means the sending and receiving of a message
             run indenpendently from other portions of your application. This
             creates a great deal of freedom in that the application has
             relief from performing the messaging tasks; the ZeroMQ threads
             handle this. <b>Both</b> sender and receiver handle the messages
             asynchronously - another benefit.</p>

        <p>Parms:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>fire reliable/forget</li>
            <li>fire response/no response</li>
            <li>response wait/no wait</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Approach:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Write server/client for each of the ten types as examples</li>
            <li>Write a readable integration of all these.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Send and Forget</h2>

        <h2>Send Reliable tagged Messages with Reply</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>The sender connects to the receiver and sends
            requests. Each request gets tagged with a unique
            identifier specfic to that message.  The sender does not
            wait, but can continues processing.</li>

            <li>The receiver then sends one or more responses.  Each
            response includes the original tag from the requesting
            message for identification.</li>

            <li>Senders can send multiple requests without waiting
            for reponses.</li>

            <li>Receivers can send multiple responses wihtout waiting
            for new requests.</li>

            <li>Multiple senders can send requests to a single
            receiver. The receiver reponds to each sender for each
            request.</li>

        </ul>
